# HealthCare Management System

## Context / Use Case

The HealthCare Management System is designed to provide an efficient and scalable solution for managing various aspects of healthcare operations. This system aims to streamline patient management, appointment scheduling, consultations, billing, notifications, and laboratory operations. By leveraging modern software architecture and design patterns, this system ensures maintainability, scalability, and ease of development.

## Technologies Used

### Microservices Architecture
The system is built using a microservices architecture, where each core functionality is encapsulated within its own service. This approach allows for independent development, deployment, and scaling of each service.

### RabbitMQ
RabbitMQ is used as the message broker to facilitate communication between different microservices. This ensures reliable and asynchronous messaging, improving the overall robustness and responsiveness of the system.

### Clean Architecture + Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
The system follows the principles of Clean Architecture and Domain-Driven Design (DDD). This combination ensures that the core business logic is decoupled from the infrastructure and framework code, promoting a clear separation of concerns and making the system more adaptable to changes.

### Monorepository
The project is organized as a monorepository, allowing all microservices and shared libraries to reside within a single repository. This setup simplifies dependency management, versioning, and collaborative development.

## Domain Organization

The HealthCare Management System is divided into the following key domains, each represented by its own microservice:

### Patients
The Patients service manages patient information, including registration, updates, and medical history. It ensures that all patient data is securely stored and easily accessible.

### Appointments
The Appointments service handles the scheduling of patient appointments with healthcare providers. It manages the availability of providers and ensures that appointments are booked efficiently.

### Consultations
The Consultations service records and manages details of medical consultations, including diagnoses, prescriptions, and treatment plans. This service ensures that consultation data is accurately recorded and can be retrieved as needed.

### Billing
The Billing service processes and manages financial transactions related to healthcare services. It handles invoicing, payments, and maintains a record of all financial activities.

### Notifications
The Notifications service sends alerts and reminders to patients and healthcare providers. This includes appointment reminders, test result notifications, and other relevant communications.

### Laboratory
The Laboratory service manages lab test orders and results. It ensures that test data is accurately recorded and accessible to healthcare providers for informed decision-making.
